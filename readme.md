This is a Ruby implementation of a basic spell-correction algorithm described in [Peter Norvig's essay](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)

__spell_correct.py__ contains the original Python program  
__spell_correct1.rb__ is a Ruby implementation, rather ugly  
__spell_correct2.rb__ better looking Ruby implementation, but using monkey patching.  
__spell_correct3.rb__ better looking, uses refinements instead of moneky patching. 

(spell-correct.rb contains a practice implementation, similar to that in spell_correct1.rb)
